# Data Lineage

Track where data originates, how it is transformed, and where outputs are consumed.

## To document

- Data sources and owners
- Ingestion dates and methods
- Transformation steps (`data/raw` -> `data/interim` -> `data/processed`)
- SQL dependencies and output artifacts
- Reporting assets tied to final datasets
