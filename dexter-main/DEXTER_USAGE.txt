Dexter Quick Start

1) Start the CLI
- Navigate to the project:
  cd "/Users/jobkimani/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/JOB/personal stuff/learning centre/STATISTTICS/projects for practice/POLYMARKET/dexter-main"
- Launch with Bun (absolute path if not on PATH):
  ~/.bun/bin/bun start

2) Inside the CLI
- Switch model: type /model and choose OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google.
- Set API keys when prompted; they will be saved to .env.
- If already set, keys load automatically on startup.

3) Polymarket tool (local reports)
- Ask questions like:
  - Load the latest top 24h Polymarket markets and summarize notable moves.
  - From the latest all active markets file, list the top 10 by liquidity.
  - Show markets with implied Yes probability above 0.7 in the latest top24h report.
- The tool reads CSVs from reports/ or polymarket-research/reports/.

4) Troubleshooting
- Bun not found:
  - exec /bin/zsh
  - which bun
  - If needed, use ~/.bun/bin/bun
- Missing credentials:
  - Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set in .env, then restart:
    ~/.bun/bin/bun start
- Web search optional:
  - Set TAVILY_API_KEY in .env for search_web tool; otherwise it returns a friendly message.

5) Optional convenience
- Create a shell alias (in ~/.zshrc) to launch quickly:
  alias dexter='cd "/Users/jobkimani/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/JOB/personal stuff/learning centre/STATISTTICS/projects for practice/POLYMARKET/dexter-main" && ~/.bun/bin/bun start'

Notes
- Use ~/.bun/bin/bun for all Bun commands if bun is not on PATH.
- To change providers later, use /model inside the CLI.
